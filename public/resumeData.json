    "bio": "I'm a photographer based in Los Angeles, California who specializes in photographing architecture; I also have a mild airplane obsession.I grew up in Ipswich, Massachusetts: a small coastal town that's one part postcard and one part dramatic Boston movie.  Here I was lucky enough to meet a number of amazing teachers who opened my eyes to the world of art and design; this would alter the path of my life in more ways than I could ever imagine. After studying studio art and environmental science at the University of Vermont,  I moved to Lake Tahoe, California, in hopes of becoming a professional snowboarder (graduating right after the '08 recession made this seem like a great idea). A couple of years and too many injuries later, I found myself taking up an offer to photograph a few homes for a client I'd met while recuperating. What started by chance turned out to be the perfect mix of technical challenge and creative outlet, and I decided right there and then that it absolutely must be my career. In 2018, I founded the Architectural Photography Almanac, a resource for architecture photographers and those in the architecture industry seeking to learn about the craft and theory of architectural photography.",
